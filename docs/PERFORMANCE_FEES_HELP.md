# Performance Fees - Help & FAQ

## How It Works

**5% of profits. No profits, no fee.**

When your trading bot closes a trade with profit, we take 5%. If your bot loses money, you pay nothing.

### Example

```
Your bot makes $500 profit on a trade
  Platform fee: 5% of $500 = $25
  You keep: $475
```

### When You're Charged

- Fees accumulate throughout the month
- On the **1st of each month**, all pending fees are charged in one payment
- You receive a receipt email
- Fees under $1.00 roll forward to next month (no micro-charges)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up Billing

When you create your first trading bot:
1. Click **"Create Bot"**
2. Enter your payment information (credit/debit card)
3. Authorize the payment method
4. Done - you won't be charged until your bot makes a profit

### Step 2: Your Bot Trades

Your bot executes trades. For each profitable trade, 5% is set aside as a pending fee.

### Step 3: Monthly Billing

On the 1st of each month, all pending fees are charged to your card in one invoice.
